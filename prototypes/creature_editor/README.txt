Christian Rondeau's Creature Editor Prototype

Has the following functions currently:

- Basic player inventory system 
- Basic inventory display (mostly for debugging)
- Simple item pickup


Needs implementation/correction:

- Main editor display
- drag and drop items to player body
- body editing system (detection of drag and drop parts)
